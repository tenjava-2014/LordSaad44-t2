Creeper Stone
-----------

Creepers have a rare drop called creeper stone (enchanted sulphur).
Creeper stone can be used as furnace fuel/energy and can smelt up to 50 items.
Creeper stone can also act as redstone wiring by normally placing it on the ground.
Charged creepers drop 10 creeper stones while normal creepers have a rare chance of dropping one creeper stone.
Creeper stone is good energy.
